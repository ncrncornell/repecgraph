\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
The core data is derived from the \repec~ data archives. Basic data on person nodes, including a list of author-edges,  is available in \href{http://openlib.org/acmes/root/docu/redif_1.html}{ReDIF} \cite{RePEc:rpc:rdfdoc:redif} format from the \repec :per archive at \url{ftp://ftp.repec.org/opt/ReDIF/RePEc/per/}. All persons, institutions, and papers/articles are indexed by their \repec~ handle. 

\subsection{ReDIF source data}
The ReDIF data format is a machine-readable yet humanly interpretable metadata format \cite{RePEc:rpc:rdfdoc:redif}. Its basic structure for a field is 
\begin{lstlisting}
field_name: field value
\end{lstlisting}
Of interest to this paper are the following fields: \lstinline|Short-ID| identifies person-node, \lstinline|author-paper|, \lstinline|author-article|, \lstinline|author-book| identify written products (`entities') that may be co-authored, and thus implicitly identify some of the edges of the graph. We could also use \lstinline|Workplace-Institution| as an additional node identifier, but defer this to future work. For the work here, data on the actual papers is not necessary, but may be used to populate the user interface. Deduplication of papers (papers with same names) are identified in the form of Perl statements at \url{ftp://repec.oru.se/RePEc/cpd/conf/relatedworks.dat}. The data for the \repec~Genealogy database is not (yet) publicly available.

Pre-computed network metrics for persons is available through the \href{http://collec.repec.org/}{CollEc} project at \url{ftp://ftp.repec.org/opt/CollEc/CollEc.txt} in the form of tabular data. 

\section{Graph components}

\subsection{Thesis}
The data for the thesis components are derived from \repec~ Genealogy. It encompasses a single \emph{entity} type (thesis), a single \emph{activity} (implicit in the data: Ph.D.) combined via two \emph{relationships} or \emph{roles} -- advisor and author of the thesis -- as well as associated \emph{agents}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ph.D.: Activity
\item Entity: Thesis
\item Agent: Advisor
\item Agent: Ph.D. Candidate/Author
\end{enumerate}
Note that we will define a generic thesis ``entity'' with each thesis in the database being a specialization of this generic entity. 
\subsubsection*{Agents}
\lstset{language=XML,breaklines=true}

\mylstinputlisting{theses-agents.xml}{XML file attached}

\subsubsection*{Entities}

\mylstinputlisting{theses-entities.xml}{XML file attached}

Note that the thesis could be fleshed out with full bibliographic information, although that information may not be available within the \repec~ network. Our definition includes a generic ``advisor'' activity, although we will not use that, instead highlighting that relationship through a ``role.''
\subsubsection*{Activities}
\mylstinputlisting{theses-activities.xml}{XML file attached}
\subsubsection*{Linking them}
\mylstinputlisting{theses-links1.xml}{XML file attached}
Pulling these together generates the simple subgraph in Figure~\ref{fig:thesis:basic}:
\begin{figure}
\caption{Thesis graph}\label{fig:thesis:basic}
\include{tikz-thesis}
\end{figure}
However, by explicitly incorporating attributions, we recover the original database construction.
\lstinputlisting{theses-links2.xml}{XML file attached}
Incorporating this into the graph, we first obtain a more complex graph (Figure~\ref{fig:thesis:complex}):
\begin{figure}
\caption{Thesis graph with attribution}\label{fig:thesis:complex}
\include{tikz-thesis-complex}
\end{figure}
However, collapsing the graph to only the attribution links yields a representation amenable to the usual bipartite graph visualization (Figure~\ref{fig:thesis:bipartite}).

\begin{figure}
\caption{Theses as bipartite graph}\label{fig:thesis:bipartite}
\include{tikz-bipartite-thesis}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Co-authorship}
The \repec~ coauthorship network already exists at \url{http://collec.repec.org}. (internal representation to be added here).

Implicit in that network is a simple bi-partite network between articles (entities) and authors (agents). Translated into PROV (\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-primer-20130430/}), the definition of agents are as before, whereas the new entities are
\subsubsection*{Entities}
\mylstinputlisting{coauthor-entities.xml}{XML file attached}

\subsubsection*{Activities}
For completeness, we define a research activity to generate articles and papers, although we could directly associate the paper with its authors:
\mylstinputlisting{coauthor-activities.xml}{XML file attached}

\subsubsection*{Linking them}
\mylstinputlisting{coauthor-links.xml}{XML file attached}

Pulling these together generates the subgraph in Figure~\ref{fig:author:complex}.
\begin{figure}
\caption{Authorship with latent research activity}\label{fig:author:complex}
\include{tikz-authorship}
\end{figure}

The indirect association with the (latent) research activity is implicit in \repec 's linkage of different versions of the same article. Alternatively, these could be noted as revisions; however, the linkage through a research activity is potentially more general. In this case, the attribution is directly coded in the \repec~ database, and the implicit research activity is deduced.

\mylstinputlisting{coauthor-links2.xml}{XML file attached}


\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with direct attribution}\label{fig:author:morecomplex}
\include{tikz-authorship-complex}
\end{figure}
For simplicity, a simplified version of the graph, omitting the latent research activity, more closely approximates the bipartite representation:

\include{tikz-authorship-simple}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[ht]

\include{tikz-bipartite-coauthor}
\end{figure}

\section{Combining the subgraphs}
\label{sec:combine}
We set up the subgraphs such that concepts are identical, and in particular, theses can be treated in much the same way that published articles and working papers can be: they are written artifacts (``entities'') of a particular type, that are associated with authors (``agents''). The connectedness of the authorship network is entirely driven by co-author relations: entities with more than one edge generated connected groups. Adding theses to such a network does not change much: almost by definition, each theses has only one author. The average degree of the network might be slightly reduced, in fact, although the \repec~ network has an upward bias in the degrees - authors who only publish their thesis and then exit academia, and who those have a low degree, are (probably) under-represented. Figure~\ref{fig:author:theses} shows the bipartite representation of the \repec~ network with theses added in.%
\footnote{Note that theses are not captured by the \repec~ network, and thus don't actually have an entry.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with theses}\label{fig:author:theses}
\include{tikz-bipartite-coauthor-theses}
\end{figure}

However, by adding in a new type of link -- advisorship --, the \repec~ collaboration network quite naturally is extended, and a substantial amount of new edges are added (Figure~\ref{fig:author:theses:complete}).
\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with theses and advisors}\label{fig:author:theses:complete}
\include{tikz-bipartite-coauthor-theses-complete}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\section{Network metrics before and after}
\label{sec:metrics}

We should compute the network metrics before and after the inclusion of thesis advisors in the collaboration network. (average number of edges, average path length, changes in ranking of betweenness).
\clearpage
\section{An exploratory interface}
\label{sec:interface}
In order to provide a graphical frontend to the expanded network, we proceeded as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Combined information from the CollEC activity (list of the authorship network) with information from the \repec~ Genealogy project (list of thesis advisors and advisees). Because thesis titles themselves are not captured, we define an implicit thesis entity; however, future enhancements to the \repec~ Genealogy database may capture actual thesis titles, a complete list of advisors (when they are not yet identified on the \repec~ network), and possibly URIs for each thesis.
\item We note that the CollEC activity already defines a mechanism for storing node and edge information; the Genealogy project data is translated into this format to create the basis for the expanded network.
\item A PROV representation of the data (as per the specifications defined earlier) is created (optional, but desirable)
\item Finally, a graphical network browser that efficiently handles following edges to nodes (=entities) of all kinds, showing summary information while in the browser, and exiting to the full information on each node (people, institutions, articles and papers, datasets) when requested.
\end{itemize}


Here plug in the graphical interface. See examples of a thesis-based graph at \url{http://www.vrdc.cornell.edu/repecgraph/} and Figure~\ref{fig:webinterface-pvi26}. An example mechanism is being developed at \url{http://dev.ncrn.cornell.edu/ced2ar-web/prov2/} and may serve as the basis.

\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}
Already present in the \repec~ network are citation links (linking papers among themselves). This work links in with CED$^2$AR work (citations) and other efforts for linking papers and articles to the data used for (empirical) papers. Establishing such links can be represented by a tripartite graph:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with theses, data}\label{fig:tripartite}
\include{tikz-tripartite}
\end{figure}
This will ultimately allow to attribute authorship for certain datasets in a clear fashion, which is currently not usual in the social sciences.\footnote{See ICPSR examples, however.} For an example, see Figure~\ref{fig:tripartite-hilite}.
