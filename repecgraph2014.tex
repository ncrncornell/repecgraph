\section{Graph components}

\subsection{Thesis}
The data for the thesis components are derived from \repec~ Genealogy. It encompasses a single \emph{entity} type (thesis), a single \emph{activity} (implicit in the data: Ph.D.) combined via two \emph{relationships} or \emph{roles} -- advisor and author of the thesis -- as well as associated \emph{agents}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ph.D.: Activity
\item Entity: Thesis
\item Agent: Advisor
\item Agent: Ph.D. Candidate/Author
\end{enumerate}
Note that we will define a generic thesis ``entity'' with each thesis in the database being a specialization of this generic entity. 
\subsubsection*{Agents}
\lstset{language=XML,breaklines=true}

\mylstinputlisting{theses-agents.xml}{XML file attached}

\subsubsection*{Entities}

\mylstinputlisting{theses-entities.xml}{XML file attached}

Note that the thesis could be fleshed out with full bibliographic information, although that information may not be available within the \repec~ network. Our definition includes a generic ``advisor'' activity, although we will not use that, instead highlighting that relationship through a ``role.''
\subsubsection*{Activities}
\mylstinputlisting{theses-activities.xml}{XML file attached}
\subsubsection*{Linking them}
\mylstinputlisting{theses-links1.xml}{XML file attached}
Pulling these together generates the simple subgraph in Figure~\ref{fig:thesis:basic}:
\begin{figure}
\caption{Thesis graph}\label{fig:thesis:basic}
\include{tikz-thesis}
\end{figure}
However, by explicitly incorporating attributions, we recover the original database construction.
\lstinputlisting{theses-links2.xml}{XML file attached}
Incorporating this into the graph, we first obtain a more complex graph (Figure~\ref{fig:thesis:complex}):
\begin{figure}
\caption{Thesis graph with attribution}\label{fig:thesis:complex}
\include{tikz-thesis-complex}
\end{figure}
However, collapsing the graph to only the attribution links yields a representation amenable to the usual bipartite graph visualization (Figure~\ref{fig:thesis:bipartite}).

\begin{figure}
\caption{Theses as bipartite graph}\label{fig:thesis:bipartite}
\include{tikz-bipartite-thesis}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Co-authorship}
The \repec~ coauthorship network already exists at \url{http://collec.repec.org}. (internal representation to be added here).

Implicit in that network is a simple bi-partite network between articles (entities) and authors (agents). Translated into PROV, the definition of agents are as before, whereas the new entities are
\subsubsection*{Entities}
\mylstinputlisting{coauthor-entities.xml}{XML file attached}

\subsubsection*{Activities}
For completeness, we define a research activity to generate articles and papers, although we could directly associate the paper with its authors:
\mylstinputlisting{coauthor-activities.xml}{XML file attached}

\subsubsection*{Linking them}
\mylstinputlisting{coauthor-links.xml}{XML file attached}

Pulling these together generates the subgraph in Figure~\ref{fig:author:complex}.
\begin{figure}
\caption{Authorship with latent research activity}\label{fig:author:complex}
\include{tikz-authorship}
\end{figure}

The indirect association with the (latent) research activity is implicit in \repec 's linkage of different versions of the same article. Alternatively, these could be noted as revisions; however, the linkage through a research activity is potentially more general. In this case, the attribution is directly coded in the \repec~ database, and the implicit research activity is deduced.

\mylstinputlisting{coauthor-links2.xml}{XML file attached}


\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with direct attribution}\label{fig:author:morecomplex}
\include{tikz-authorship-complex}
\end{figure}
For simplicity, a simplified version of the graph, omitting the latent research activity, more closely approximates the bipartite representation:
\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with direct attribution}\label{fig:author:simple}
\include{tikz-authorship-simple}
\end{figure}

\include{tikz-bipartite-coauthor}
\end{figure}

\section{Combining the subgraphs}
\label{sec:combine}
We set up the subgraphs such that concepts are identical, and in particular, theses can be treated in much the same way that published articles and working papers can be: they are written artifacts (``entities'') of a particular type, that are associated with authors (``agents''). The connectedness of the authorship network is entirely driven by co-author relations: entities with more than one edge generated connected groups. Adding theses to such a network does not change much: almost by definition, each theses has only one author. The average degree of the network might be slightly reduced, in fact, although the \repec~ network has an upward bias in the degrees - authors who only publish their thesis and then exit academia, and who those have a low degree, are (probably) under-represented. Figure~\ref{fig:author:theses} shows the bipartite representation of the \repec~ network with theses added in.%
\footnote{Note that theses are not captured by the \repec~ network, and thus don't actually have an entry.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with theses}\label{fig:author:theses}
\include{tikz-bipartite-coauthor-theses}
\end{figure}

However, by adding in a new type of link -- advisorship --, the \repec~ collaboration network quite naturally is extended, and a substantial amount of new edges are added (Figure~\ref{fig:author:theses:complete}).
\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with theses and advisors}\label{fig:author:theses:complete}
\include{tikz-bipartite-coauthor-theses-complete}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

\section{Network metrics before and after}
\label{sec:metrics}

We should compute the network metrics before and after the inclusion of thesis advisors in the collaboration network. (average number of edges, average path length, changes in ranking of betweenness).

\section{An exploratory interface}
\label{sec:interface}
Here plug in the graphical interface. See example at \url{http://www.vrdc.cornell.edu/repecgraph/} and Figure~\ref{fig:webinterface-pvi26}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Example webinterface}\label{fig:webinterface-pvi26}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{web-interface-pvi26}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}
Already present in the \repec~ network are citation links (linking papers among themselves). This work links in with CED$^2$AR work (citations) and other efforts for linking papers and articles to the data used for (empirical) papers. Establishing such links can be represented by a tripartite graph:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Authorship with theses, data}\label{fig:tripartite}
\include{tikz-tripartite}
\end{figure}
This will ultimately allow to attribute authorship for certain datasets in a clear fashion, which is currently not usual in the social sciences.\footnote{See ICPSR examples, however.} For an example, see Figure~\ref{fig:tripartite-hilite}.
